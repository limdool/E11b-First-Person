# E11b-First-Person

Today, I built 3D first person shooter game using Godot. As usual, I forked and cloned the given repository on Canvas. Then, I opened Godot, chose a location for the repository, imported the file. For building the game, I used the following link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_55ktNdarxY.

The link is YouTube video shows how to build a simple 3D first person shooter game. Although the video explained well, there was one part that I could not work through it. It was a script attached to the character. I used exact same code that was used in the video but my character could not move around like the character moving around in the video. Later, I got help from my instructor. After getting help, my character was finally able to move around. The character can now move around and jump. 

It moves around by using the following keys: WASD. It jumps when 'Spacebar' is pressed. The camera can be controlled with the mouse.  

After that, I downloaded a weapon pack from https://kenney.nl/assets/weapon-pack. 

For giving the weapon to my character, I watched the video and walked through it. 

Later, I checked if everything works well. My project worked perfectly fine. Finally, I edited LICENSE and README.md.
